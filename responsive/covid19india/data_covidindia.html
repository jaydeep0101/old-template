			<h1>COVID19-india API</h1>
			<h2>Announcement</h2>

			<p>We have stopped capturing testing data at a district level. Please check the status of the API endpoints below.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					As of 13th August our <a href="https://github.com/covid19india/api">API</a> repository and api.covid19india.org have been deprecated. We redirect api.covid19india.org to data.covid19india.org
				</li>
				<li>
					As of 13th August, all json endpoints except v4 endpoints have been deprecated. Please use the csv endpoints or refer to v4 endpoints
				</li>
			</ol>



			<h2>Files available</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Aggregated sheets provide aggregated data at the district/state levels in csv format.
				</li>

				<li>
					V4 json endpoints. These are the json apis that are used by the website to show all the statistics on the site. These can be used by developers and analysts who have knowledge of json parsing (recommended approach). All our v4 endpoints are actively developed and in use since this serves the frontend view Documentation for the same.
				</li>
				<li>
					Latest data from the google sheet (10-20 minutes delayed) is available through the latest end-point. These are present under the raw files section below. (Not recommended since the number of files is huge and there is no additional information present in these as compared to the above mentioned endpoints.)
				</li>
			</ul>
